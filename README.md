# AIStockGen
Stock Photo Generator with Spring AI
A full-stack web application built with Spring Boot and Spring AI to generate high-quality, unique stock photos from text descriptions by leveraging OpenAI's DALL-E model.

## Key Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Create vibrant, contextually relevant images simply by providing a textual prompt.

Seamless AI Integration: Uses the Spring AI framework to abstract the complexity of connecting to and interacting with generative AI models.

Full-Stack Architecture: A complete, self-contained application with a backend powered by Spring Boot and a user-facing web interface.

Extensible Design: The core logic can be extended to support other generative tasks, such as creating structured text like recipes or articles.

## Technology Stack
This project combines a modern Java backend with powerful generative AI services.

Backend:

Java 17+

Spring Boot 3: For building robust, stand-alone web applications.

Spring Web: For creating RESTful APIs and handling web requests.

Maven: For project dependency management.

Artificial Intelligence:

Spring AI: To simplify the integration of AI models.

OpenAI DALL-E API: The underlying model used for image generation.

Frontend:

A simple, user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, likely using Thymeleaf for server-side rendering with Spring Boot.
